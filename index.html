                        A mobile app designed to allow users to offer rides to other users within the app with the main target audience of college students. I was initially just a back-end developer on this project, but was elected project manager when the project had neared the end of its development cycle with little-to-no product to show for. I overtook the year-long project, was able to get the team motivated, and made leaps and bounds of progress in a fraction of the total development time, all while I still contributed my back-end knowledge to the project. I lead the front-end design to push forward on their work and worked in one-on-one sessions to make sure the project was presentation ready for our stakeholders.

                        I designed an developed an online, browser based environment for learning about Trusted Platform Module (TPM). It made use of Google code labs to present an interactive tutorial for users to understand the processes of TPM. I oversaw the content of the tutorial and revisioned it to fit a classroom environment. I rewrote many modules within this tutorial and worked on the seperation of inline code and informational content so that future students could better understand the material
